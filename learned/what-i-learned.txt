- We can use the CSS property called INSET which corresponds to 
top, right, bottom and left position properties

- The z-index property specifies the stack order of an element

- The pointer-events property defines whether or not an element reacts to pointer events

- The :focus pseudo selector styles an input field when it gets focused

- The :valid pseudo selector styles an input field if there is any text in it (needs the "required"
attribute in HTML). This pseudo selector also allows us to see if any text matches
the format we want (in this case it requires the "value" attribute in HTML)

- We can handle CSS pseudo elements by JS using the setProperty method. First of all, we set a variable
in any CSS property value and then we modify them, calling the real element in JS

- It's possible to improve the user zoom experience, using "maximum-scale" and "viewport-fit=cover" 
in the HTML viewport tag

- It's very useful to define media queries using sass mixins, which allows us to have cleaner code 
and make it more professional
